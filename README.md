### Project Topic: Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) Inventory

### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims analyzing the given data and presentation of key insights and Findings on KMS Abuja Division Sales Inventory.

### Data Sources
The primary source of Data used is KMS Abuja Division Database (main) and Order Status. This is a data that can be easily sourced from an open source online from Kaggle among others.
 
### Tools Used

-  My SQL (Structured Query Language)[Download Here](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)
  - For Data Storage and Data Sourcing
  - For Data Querying 
   - For Data Cleaning and Filtering

### Data Loading and Set-up
At the preliminary stage of this, I performed Data Loading and Set-up. These include: 
-	Creation of a database called KMS_db
-	Loading of KMS SQL Case Study as a flat file to the database.
-	Setting up of the database using Order_id as primary key.
-	Altering of monetary data type from float to Discount decimal (10,2).

``` SQL

alter table [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
alter column sales decimal (10,2)

```

#### Explanation

The company didn't spend shipping cost based in order priority. This is because irrespective of the priority placed on the product, delivery truck was used the more. This is because products are urgently demanded for by the customers, and economical for both customers and the company as shown in the value it returned in the query.
